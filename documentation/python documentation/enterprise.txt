FUNCTIONS
    CheckForEnterpriseTables(map_document)
        Check the input map document for the three tables that are necessary
        for exporting or analyzing data in the CR Enterprise:
        CLI Feature Table, CR Link Table, and CR Catalog Table
        
        Returns False if one of the three is missing from table of contents.
    
    ConvertFeatureXLSToGDBTable(input_xls_file_path, output_location, update_local_table=False)
        Takes an excel workbook that has been created using the CLI Feature
        Info query in the CLI online database, and subsequently has been cleaned
        up following the procedures outlined in "How to Prepare an Update for
        the CLI Feature Table" documentation included in this toolbox folder.
        The values from the excel sheet will be read and then written to a new
        table in a new file geodatabase.
        
        This process is designed to ensure easy and clean updates to the CLI
        Feature Table that will be served through the NPS CR Enterprise
        database. The intention is that the resulting file geodatabase table
        can be sent to the data editor who will not need to do any sort of QA/QC
        before using it to replace the existing CLI Feature Table in the NPS CR
        Enterprise database.
    
    ExtractFromEnterpriseQuery(map_document, query_code, output_location, only_cr_link=False)
        This function must be used from the CR Enterprise Access map
        document.  It will take the input query code and extract all data that
        matches it from each layer in the table of contents.  The user may only
        download the CR Link table for these records, if desired.
    
    ExtractFromEnterpriseSelection(map_document, output_location, only_cr_link=False)
        This function must be used from the CR Enterprise Access map
        document.  Any currently selected features are downloaded to a new
        geodatabase.  The user can chose to only download the CR Link table
        records for all selected features.
    
    MakeUnitTableFromFeatureTable(table_geodatabase)
        This function will look in the input table geodatabase for a table
        called FeatureInfoLookup.  If it exists, it will look for the existing
        corresponding UnitInfoLookup table, from which it must pull the
        UNIT_TYPE information which is not already in the FeatureInfoLookup
        table.  Then the FeatureInfoLookup table will be read, reordered, and
        written to a new table that will take the place of the existing
        UnitInfoLookup table.
    
    UpdateCLITables(map_document)
        This tool takes no parameters.  It must be run from the CR_Enterprise
        _Public_Access map document.  It uses the table view in the map document
        of the CLI Feature Table to pull information to the local lookup tables
        that are used in all of these functions throughout the clitools package.
        This tool should be run by the user every time the CR CR_Enterprise
        version of the CLI Feature Table is updated.
    
    strftime(...)
        strftime(format[, tuple]) -> string
        
        Convert a time tuple to a string according to a format specification.
        See the library reference manual for formatting codes. When the time tuple
        is not present, current time as returned by localtime() is used.
